    <h1>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) With JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      OOP is a programming paradigm that allows us to structure our code in an
      object-oriented way. It is based on the concept of "objects", which are
      instances of classes. Classes are templates for objects, and they define the
      properties and behavior of the objects that are created from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In OOP, objects can communicate with each other by sending and receiving
      messages. Messages are method calls, and the receiving object responds to
      the message by executing the corresponding method. This allows objects to
      interact with each other in a meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      OOP also allows us to create complex systems by using inheritance. In
      inheritance, a class can inherit the properties and behavior of another
      class, and then add its own unique properties and behavior on top of that.
      This allows us to create a hierarchy of classes, with each class building on
      the previous one.
